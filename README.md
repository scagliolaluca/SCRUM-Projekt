# SCRUM-Projekt

## Chrome Extension:
Add this chrome extension to your chrome extensions by activating the "developer mode" in your extension-manager. Then go to "Load Unpacked" and select the "MultipleChoiceGuide" Folder. 

## Toolchain: 
For the usage of this Chrome Extension, only Google Chrome and this repository is needed. The Extension works with JavaScript for any logic and HTML for displaying things.
The extraction and Highlighting of Keywords, the extraction of the number of questions to be crossed, the extraction of the number of questions currently crossed, as well as the check if both are the same, happens in the content.js. For both, we added EventListeners connected to different Events in the HTML-Code of the Scrum Quiz.
